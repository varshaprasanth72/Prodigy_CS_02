 ## Image Encryption and Decryption

## Overview

The Python program implements a simple image encryption and decryption tool using basic pixel manipulation techniques. The program allows users to encrypt and decrypt images by performing operations such as swapping pixel values.


## Requirements

Python: The program is written in Python, so you'll need a Python interpreter installed on your system.

Pillow (Python Imaging Library - Fork): Pillow is a fork of the Python Imaging Library (PIL), which adds support for opening, manipulating, and saving many different image file formats.

                 pip install Pillow

## Usage

1. To get the the code

              git clone https://github.com/varshaprasanth72/Prodigy_CS_02

2. Navigate to the directory

3. Run the Program
   
            python3 Prodigy_cs_02.py


## Example

Enter the path to the image: <path>

Enter the operation (swap/multiply): multiply

Enter the key (integer): 5

Image encrypted successfully

Image decrypted successfully
